In this lesson, you will be introduced to the programming language, `R`. After installing the related software and getting a basic idea of the R Studio interface, you will learn three `R` basics: operators, objects, and packages. 

Unlike other statistical software like SPSS and STATA, `R` is a free, open-source software for performing statistical analysis and data visualization. In addition, `R` offers more analytical solutions, flexibility, and customization than these commonly used statistical software, and its popularity has increased substantially over the years. 

We learn `R` because we hope that this is an important tool that you will continue to use in future. As it is free and has a community feel to it where anyone can create and upload new techniques, the idea is that you can use `R` long after this course. Even if data analysis is not in the future for you, learning how to conduct and interpret statistical output is a good skill to have – much of our knowledge of the world includes statistics, so understanding the numbers and how they were derived are advantages. `R` uses a language called **object-oriented programming**, and though it may seem daunting at first, practice makes familiarity. Also, you can impress your friends with all your coding.

## Install R & R Studio

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

R and R Studio are free software. Therefore you should be able to install on your own machines at home. Of course we realise everyone is working with different IT, so there are some options that mean that everyone will be able to participate. Our first activity for today will be to decide what approach to working with R and R Studio will be best for you. 


### Activity 1: Identifying your operating system

In this activity, you need to answer a question about your computer/IT that you will be working with throughout this module. That question is: 

- **What is your operating system**? Operating system refers to the software that your computer is running to deliver the basic functions. You may have for example: 

  + *Windows or Linux* - if you have these, you are most likely going to have an easy time installing R and R Studio, so you should give the installation instructions a try
  + *Apple* - if you have a Mac, it is still not too tough to install R and R Studio, but there are some additional hurdles you will have to cross. Specifically there will be an additional program to download (Xcode), and additional steps here and there. It's not impossible, but you should be a little bit comfortable with computers. 
  + *Chromebook* - Installing R and R Studio on a Chromebook involved installing Linux on your Chromebook. Again, like with a Mac, it's not impossible, but just takes a little bit of resilience.
  
In your group google sheets (or if you're working alone, then in a notebook), write down which operating system you have. This will guide which directions to follow later. 




<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

### Activity 2: Install R & R Studio


#### Some notes specific to your operating system. 

Remember that we spoke above about how installation will differ between your operating system? Well look back now, to your answer to activity 1, and based on that, before you move on to the installation steps below, read or watch the advice specific to your operating system here

- Windows: click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLWaED9jTiA) for instructions 
- Chromebook: read the tutorial [here](https://blog.sellorm.com/2018/12/20/installing-r-and-rstudio-on-a-chromebook/)
- Mac, follow the guidance in the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs&list=PLqzoL9-eJTNDw71zWePXyHx3_cm_fMP8S) and then, you will also need to install command line tools, for that you can watch another video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yd9J_dhSfY) 
- Linux: for ubuntu see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF0-FH-xBiE), but honestly, if you're running Linux, I'm not worried about your ability to install R and R Studio, I feel like, you'll tackle this easily. That said if you have questions, let the teaching team know!


Once you have watched/ read the instructions for your relevant operating system, you are now ready to actually have a go at downloading for yourself. Before you start, write in the google doc any questions/worries/etc, and once you're ready, have a go.  

#### Install `R`: {-}

1. Go to https://www.r-project.org/ 

2. Click the [download R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) link under the *Getting Started* heading 

3. You will be asked to select a Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) mirror. Click the URL closest to your location

4. Click whichever download link is appropriate for your operating system (see above).

5. Then click the *install R for the first-time* link and proceed to install `R`

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

#### Install R Studio: {-}

1. Go to https://rstudio.com/

2. Click the *Download* link

3. Scroll down and then click the DOWNLOAD button for the free version of
`RStudio`

4. You will be taken to a website to download the free version of `RStudio` that is appropriate for your computer. Download and then install it.


#### Plan B: accessing R Studio remotely throught a web browser

It might be that after all the videos, and all the attempts, you find that there are some issues specific to your computer, or something just isn't working for you. Unfortunately, there are many of you and few of us, so there is a chance that we just cannot get it working for you on your own machine. In that case, you have two options. 

- *Option 1:* You can remotely access one of the university PCs from your browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc). You can find instructions how to do this [here](https://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/students/pc-on-campus/remote-cluster-access/) And the university IT helpdesk can help you access this too. If you do this, you will be able to use the version of RStudio installed in the computer clusters. 

- *Option 2*: You can access an online version of R Studio, which you can access through any web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc). To do this, you can visit [https://rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/), click on "get started for free", choose the free account and click on "sign up". Then you can always visit this website and log in in order to use R Studio in the cloud. Note that you should start a "New Project" and name is Modelling Crime Data, and then all your work will be saved in this project.

## Getting to know R Studio

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

You only need to open `Rstudio`, (not both `R` and `RStudio`); `R` runs automatically in the background when `RStudio` is open. Using `RStudio` makes it easier to work with `R` than using `R` itself. If you do not believe this, try working directly in `R`! 

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>


![**Figure 1.1** RStudio interface](Images/rstudio.PNG){width=80%}

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>


Figure 1.1 shows you what `RStudio` looks like when you first open it: three open panes. 

The biggest one to your left is the main console, and it tells you what version of `R` you have. 


When you start working in `Rstudio`, it is best to have *four* open panes. **How?** Let's explore in the next activity. 

#### Activity 3: Opening up the script pane

Figure 1.2: Click in the *File* drop down Menu, select *New File*, then *R Script*.

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

![**Figure 1.2** Creating an R Script](Images/R script.png){width=70%}

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

You can shift between different panes and re-size them with your mouse too.

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

![**Figure 1.3** Main window in `RStudio`](Images/main window.png){width=70%}

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>


### The four panes of R Studio

The purposes of the four panes in Figure 1.3 are the following:

1. **Script and data view**: where you type your programming code that tells `R` what you want to do. These are essentially instructions that you type and save as a **script**, so that you can return to it later to remember what you did and to share it with others so that they can reproduce what you did.

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
</div>

2. **Environment and history view**: 
  i) *2.1 Environment* tab- gives you the names of all the (data) objects that you have defined during your current `R` session, including number of observations and rows in those objects. We learn more about objects later. 

  ii) *2.2 History* tab- shows you a history of all the code you have previously evaluated in the main console.

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
</div>

3. **Main console**: this is considered `R's` heart, and it is where `R` evaluates the codes that you run. You can type your codes directly in the console, but for the sake of good habits, type them in the script and data view so you can save a record of them. Only type and run code from here if you want to debug or do some quick analysis.

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
</div>

4. **File directory, Plots, Packages, Help**:
  i) *4.1 Files* tab-  allows you to see the files in the folder that is currently set as your working directory. 

  ii) *4.2 Plots* tab- you will see any data visualizations that you produce here. You have not produced any yet, so it is empty now.

  iii) *4.3 Packages* tab- you will see the packages that are currently available to install. We will explain what these are soon, but know that they are an essential feature when working with `R`.

  iv) *4.4 Help* tab- you can access further information on the various packages. 
  
  
#### Activity 4: Interacting with the 4 panes

In the previous activity, you opened up the 'script' pane. Not we are going to test out writing some code in there, and seeing what happens. 


To do this, go to your open version of R Studio, and type in the script pane the following: 

```{r hellowrold, eval=F}

print("Hello world!")

```

When you have typed this, you will have typed your first bit of code. How exciting is that?! But wait, nothing is happening... you typed this... but it's not getting printed!??

Well, it is not enough to type your code, you also have to **RUN** the code. 

You can do this by highlighting the code you wish to run, and clicking on "run" in the top right hand corner.  Like so: 

![](Images/run_hello_world.gif)
Now you can see, if you do this, the result of your code (the printing of the text "Hello world" will print out in the bottom pane, the **console**)! You have now written and executed code!! Well done, eh?


In the rest of the session we will be unpacking how this all works, and getting more familiar and comfortable with using R Studio. 


---

### Customising R Studio 
<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

A bit of fun, before we move on. Did you know, you can change the way `RStudio` looks? Click in the *Tools* menu and select *Global options*. A pop up window appears with various options: 

![](Images/tools_global_options.png)

Select *Appearance*. In this section you can change things related to the appearance of R Studio (e.g. the font type and size) including the theme background that `R` will use as the interface.

![](Images/appearance_choose_tomorrow_night_bright.png)

*Tomorrow Night Bright* theme is a recommendation because it is easier on your eyes with its dark background. You can preview and then click *Apply* to select the one you like (Figure 1.4).

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

![**Figure 1.4** Tomorrow Night Bright Theme](Images/tomorrow night bright.png){width=55%}

## Today's 3 (TOPICS) 

Now that we have a basic understanding of `R`, we are ready to learn some building blocks. Each session of *Modelling Criminological Data* will focus on three substantive topics, which are the key learning outcomes for each week. Today's topics are **operators and functions**, **objects**, and **packages**. Once you have mastered these three topics, you will be ready to start using R for data analysis!

<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

---

### Operators and Functions 

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

**Operators** are symbols that tell `R` to do something specific like assigning values to vectors. They fall into four categories: arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment. For now, let us type out and run some arithmetic operators: 

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# Addition
5 + 5

# Subtraction
10 - 3

# Multiplication
2 * 5

# Division
6 / 2

```


There are other operators we will come across like *and* operator (`&`), and *or* operator (`|`), which will be handy when we start to manipulate our data sets. 

#### Activity 5: Play around with operators

Go back to your open version of R Studio, and use this to find the answer to the following: 

`12329 + 342980`
`18390 / 348` 

DO not use the calculator on your phone! I want to see you copy the results copied from the console pane, where it should output (if you're not sure how, look back up at Activity 4!)


**Functions** are similar to operators in that they *do* things. They are called by some name, usually a name which represents what it is that they do, and they are followed by brackets `()`, inside which you put whatever you want the thing the functions does done to. For example, the code we wrote in Activity 4 made use of the `print()` function. This function told R to print out into the console, whatever we put in the brackets. 

How would you get R to print out a personalised greeting? Well, the `print()` function will do the thing it does to whatever is inside it's bracket's right? So if you want to print "Hello Reka", you will need to have "Hello Reka" inside the brackets. Like so: 

```{r helloreka}

print("Hello Reka")

```


Ta-daa! 

R is full of functions, there are so many, and we will be learning many of them as the course goes. Print is fun, but most of the time, we will be using functions to help us with our data analysis. You might remember some Excel formulas we learned last semester if you took Making Sense of Criminological Data, for example getting the minimum, maximum, mean, etc of a list of numbers. R does this using functions, in a very similar way. 

For example, if we have a bunch of numbers, we just find the appropriate function to get the summary we want: 

```{r examplefuns}

mean(10, 34, 5, 3, 77)
min(10, 34, 5, 3, 77)
max(10, 34, 5, 3, 77)

```


So how can we find the function we need? Well throughout this module, we will be teaching you a long list of functions that you will be using. I recommend that for this, you create a "function cookbook", where you write down a list of functions, and next to them what they do, maybe even some examples. Here is an example of mine: 

![](Images/fn_cookbook.png)

However, you are also welcome to use google, and the website stackoverflow in particular to help you find the function you need. But be wary, especially in the beginning, that you understand what they do. One good approach is to find a function, add it to your cookbook, and then highlight it to come ask the teaching team about what it does, and how it might be different to other ways of doing things. 


#### Activity 6: Play around with operators

Now that I've said that, have a google (or a guess) about what you think is the function to get the median. Once you have a guess or answer, write it in the shared google docs. Then, use it to get the median of the numbers 10, 34, 5, 3, 77. One you have the function, run it in R and tell me what is the answer! Write this in your shared google doc (or note down for yourself if in the quiet room)




I will tell you the answer after the note below. 


<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

**NOTE1 1: ** Did you *Run* the arithmetic operators? The answers will have appeared, just like the above. If you are wondering what the # symbol means in the coding above, these are called **comments**. They are annotations you can use in your `R script` to tell `R` that what comes right after the **#** are not code to be ran. Comments are like your personal notes alongside your coding. 

**NOTE1 2: ** `R` is case-sensitive! For example:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r eval=FALSE}

# Calculating the logarithm 
Log(100)

# ERROR!
```
```{r}
# Instead, it should be:
log(100)

```

 Okay, now you know these, the answer to activity 6 was....
 
 
```{r activity6ans}

median(10, 34, 5, 3, 77)
 
```
 
 
 
Great, let's move on to our 2nd key topic for today, objects! 
---

### Objects 


<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

Everything that exists in `R` is an **object**. Think of objects as boxes where you put things in. Imagine a big, empty cardboard box. We can create this big empty box in R by simply giving it a name. Usually, you want your object/box to have a good descriptive name, which will tell people what is in it. Imagine moving house. If you have a cardboard box full of places, you might want to label it "plates". That way, when carrying, you know to be careful, and when unpacking, you know its contents will go in the kitchen. On the other hand, if you named it "box1", then this is a lot less helpful when it comes to unpacking. 


#### Activity 7: Creating an object

Anyway, let's create this object. Let's call it plates. To do this, you go to your console, and type plates. 

![](Images/plates.png)

But if you run this code, you will get an error. Let's see: 

![](Images/error_no_plates.gif)

You see the error "Error! Object plates not found". This is because you have not yet put anything inside the plates box. By naming it, you create the empty vessel but that is *nothing* without having some contents. So in order for this object to exist, you have to put something inside it, or in R speak *assign it some value*.


Thereofre, we make an object by using an *assignment operator* ( `<-` ). In other words, we assign something to an object (put something in the box). For example:


```{r addplates}

plates <- "yellow plate"

```


Now if we run this, we will see no error message, but instead, we will see the plates object appear in our *environment pane*: 

![](Images/assign_plates.gif)
Well done, this concludes this activity where you had created an object! You're getting the hang of this, eh? Here are some more examples to illustrate: 

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# Putting '10' in the 'a' box
a <- 10

# Putting 'Hello!' in the 'abc123' box
abc123 <- "Hello!"

```

In these cases we are putting the value of 10 into the object `a`, and the value of "Hello" into the object `abc123`. 

<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

Earlier, we introduced you to the Environment and History pane. We mentioned that it lists objects you defined. After making the 'a' and 'abc123' objects, they should appear in that very pane under the `Environment` tab. 


#### Types of objects


So why are objects important? Well we will be storing everything in our data analysis process in these objects. And depending on what is inside them, they are different type of objects. Here are some examples: 


**Data structures** are important objects that store your data, and there are five main types but we focus on three for this course:

1. *(atomic) vector*: an ordered set of elements that are of the same *class*. Vectors are a basic data structure in `R`. Below are five different classes of vectors:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# 1. numeric vector with three elements
my_1st_vector <- c(0.5, 8.9, 0.6) 

# 2. integer vector with addition of L at the end of the value
my_2nd_vector <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)  

# 3. logical vector
my_3rd_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) 
# 'my_4th_vector' creates a logical vector using abbreviations of True and False, but you should use the full words instead
my_4th_vector <- c(T, F) 

# 4. character vector
my_5th_vector <- c("a", "b", "c") 

# 5. complex vector (we will not use this for our class)
my_6th_vector <- c(1+0i, 2+4i) 

```


<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

2. *lists*: technically they, too, are vectors but they are more complex because they are not restricted on the length, structure, or class of the included elements. For example, to create a list containing strings, numbers, vectors and a logical, use the `list()` function, and inside the brackets, put everything tat you want to combine into a list:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

list_data <- list("teal", "sky blue", c(10, 5, 10), TRUE, 68.26, 95.46, 99.7) 
```

Above we created 'list_data', an object that contains all those things that we put inside the `list()` function, this function which serves to create a list from combining everything that is put inside its brackets. 


Use the `class()` function to confirm that the objects have been defined as a list

```{r}

class(list_data)

```


<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

3. *data frames*: also stores elements but differ from lists because they are defined by their number of columns and rows; the vectors (columns) must be of the same length. Data frames can contain different classes but each column must be of the same class. For example, if you want to combine some related vectors to make a data frame on violent American cities, use the function `data.frame()`:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# Making some relevant vectors
TopVioCities <- c("St. Louis", "Detroit", "Baltimore") # some violent US cities
VioRatePer1k = c(20.8, 20.6, 20.3) # their violence rates per 1,000 persons
State <- c("Missouri", "Michigan", "Maryland") # in what states are these cities found

#Join them to make a data frame called 'df'
df<-data.frame(TopVioCities, VioRatePer1k, State)

```


We can then view the data frame, 'df', with the View() function:

```{r viewfn, eval = F}
View(df)

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>
---

#### Activity 8: Doing things to objects

So now we've learned about what are functions (things that do things) and what are objects (the boxes that hold things). We saw some functions which help us create objects (`list()` helps us make a list, and `data.frame()` helps us make a data frame (which is similar to the kinds of data we worked with in Making Sense of Crim data, that you saw in spreadsheets)). And functions can also do things to objects. For example, we saw the function `class()` that told us about what kind of object list_data was, and `View()` which allowed us to have a look at our dataframe we called df.

Let's look back at our plates object. Remember it was the object which held our kitchen items. We added "yellow plate" to it. Now let's pack some more items, let's use the concatenate `c()` function for this again like we saw above: 

```{r}

plates <- c("yellow plate", "purple plate", "silver plate", "orange bowl")

```


Now let's say we're all packed up, we've moved, and we see this box (object) labelled plates. We want to know what is inside it. Well earlier we learned of a function that can print some information into the console. This is "`print()`". If we put our object name into the `print()` function, we can see what is inside it, it will print the contents of the object. Try this yourseves:

```{r printplates}

print(plates)

```

You see now we can see everything inside this box. We applied the `print()` function to the plates object, so this means we apply it to the contents of the vox, we print every content. 

Same when we talked about the mean and min and max. You could assign those numbers to an object, this time.


```{r listnums}


nums <- c(10, 34, 5, 3, 77)

```

Now if we want to know the mean, we can take the mean of the object `nums` which we just created:


```{r meannms}

mean(nums)

```


The object we will use most frequently though is data frames. Much like how we worked with spreadsheets in Excel in Making Sense of Crim Data, our bread and butter this semester will be working with dataframes in R. 


We created a dataframe above, if you haven't yet copied this over into your own R Studio, do this now. You should have the object `df` in your environment. When you run `View(df)` you should see this data set. Like so: 

![](Images/df_view.png)

To do something to an entire dataframe, we would use the name of its box (df) to refer to it. In the case of the `View()` function, we want to see the whole thing, so we will call `View(df)`. On the other hand, if we want to refer to only one variable in the data, (remember back to term 1 - each varible is held in each column), there is special notation to do this. 

To refer to a variable (column) inside a dataframe, you use

$dataframe name + \$ + variable name$


So to refer to the varaible `VioRatePer1k` we use the notation `df$VioRatePer1k`. 


And if we wanted to View only that column, we use: 

```{r viewonecol, eval = FALSE}

View(df$VioRatePer1k)

```


You should see: 

![](Images/view_col_only.png)


While in the case of View, this might be strange, but if we want to find out, what is the mean violence rate across our units of analysis (the cities), we would take the numeric column to calculate this: 

```{r meanviol}

mean(df$VioRatePer1k)

```


### Packages 

<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

**Packages** are a very important element of `R`. Throughout the course, and hopefully afterwards, you will find yourself installing numerous open source software packages that allow `R` to do new and different things. There are loads of packages out there. In early 2020, there were over 150,000 packages available. Anyone can write one, so you will need to be careful on which ones you use as the quality can vary. Official repositories, like [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), are your best bet for packages as they will have passed some quality controls. 

You can see what packages are available in your local install by looking at the *packages* tab in the *File directory, Plots, Packages* pane (Figure 1.5). 


<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

![**Figure 1.5** Packages Tab](Images/packages.png){width=35%}

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

A number of the packages we will use belong to a set of packages called **tidyverse**. These packages help make your data tidy. According to Statistician and Chief Scientist at `RStudio`, Hadley Wickham, transforming your data into *tidy data* is one of the most important steps of the data analysis process. It will ensure your data are in the format you need to conduct your analyses.

Packages can be installed using the `install.packages()` function. Remember that while you only need to install packages once, they need to be loaded with the `library()`function each time you open up `RStudio`. Let us install the package `dplyr` from `tidyverse` and load it:

```{r}

library(dplyr)

```


<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

A lot of code and activity appears in the console. Warnings may manifest. Most of the time, the warnings explain what is being loaded and confirm that the package is successfully loaded. If there is an error, you will have to figure out what the warnings are telling you to successfully load the package. This happens and is normal.

To double check that you have actually installed `dplyr`, go to that *File Directory, Plots, Packages* pane and click on the *Packages* tab. The list of packages is in alphabetical order and `dplyr` should be there. If there is a tick in its box, it means that this package is currently loaded and you can use it; if there is no tick, it means that it is inactive, and you will have to bring it up with `library()`, or just tick its box (Figure 1.6).

On *masking*:  sometimes packages introduce functions that have the same name as those that are already loaded into your session. When that happens, the newly loaded ones will override the previous ones. You can still use them but you will have to refer to them explicitly by bringing them up by specifying to which package they belong with `library()`.

Keep `dplyr` in mind as next week we will learn more about it!

## SUMMARY


<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

Today you installed both `R` and `RStudio` and had a gander around the `RStudio` interface. If you were bored with its default look, you could customise the interface. When working with `RStudio`, it is best to have the four panes. One had to do with the all-important **script** and we use `#` in the coding when we want to make **comments**. 

We learned about some important features of `R`. First were the **operators**. These are symbols that tell `R` what to do and come in four types. One we will use quite a bit is the *assignment operator*, which is the symbol, `<-`. Second were **objects**, which are pervasive when working with `R`. They are like boxes that you put stuff in, and we learned about three specific types of **data structure** objects: vectors, lists, and data frames. Third were packages. These are open source software that expand what `R` can do. We installed `dplyr` as an example, and we will use this `tidyverse` package in our next session.

Now one last activity about saving your work, and of using projects. 

#### Activity 9: Saving your work and projects

Finally, you want to keep your code, and you want to work in some nice orderly fashion. Remember in Making Sense of Criminological Data in term 1 we talked about workspaces. In R Studio, projects are a way to achieve this. 


Now, first things first, hopefully you have already created a separate folder on your desktop, or dropbox, or something like this. Now save the script you've been working on into this folder. By clicking on "File" and "Save as...".

Then navigate to your folder for this module, and for your script make sure to give it some meaningful name like week1lab.R or something like this. Then click 'save'.

Now, go back to "File" and select "New project..."


![](Images/file_newproj.png)

Then in the options that appear choose "Existing Directory". This is because you already have a folder for this work, this is where you saved your script just before. For me this was my folder called 'modelling2021' you saw above. 


![](Images/existing_dir.png)

So select 'Existing Directory', and on the next page use the "Browse" button to select this folder (the directory) where you saved the script earlier. Once you have done this, click on 'Create Project' on the bottom. 

![](Images/browse_proj_dir.png)

This will now open up a new R Studio window with your project. In the future, you can start right back up where you finished last time by navigating to the .Rproj file, and double clicking it. It helps you keep everything in one place, and lets R read everything from that folder.


You can read up here on why projects are useful here: [https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/01/rstudio-projects-and-working-directories-a-beginners-guide/](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/01/rstudio-projects-and-working-directories-a-beginners-guide/)

That's all for today, don't forget to do your homework task, and the quiz by next week!
