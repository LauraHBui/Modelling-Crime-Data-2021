Welcome to Modelling Criminological Data. This is the online tutorial for the class's weekly lab sessions.

The class aims to introduce you to some basic principles and ideas required to understand data analysis. This will help you develop a better grasp of the statistics batted around in the media, by politicians, and by scientists around a variety of issues. In this class, we use the data analysis software `R` to explore and analyse data, interpret statistical results, and to encourage curiosity.

Data is ubiquitous today and affects all aspects of everyday life. Criminal justice agencies are increasingly adopting a 'problem solving' and 'evidence-led' discourse that requires seeking individuals with the skills to perform basic data analytical tasks in order to document patterns of crime problems, factors associated with them, and to evaluate responses to these problems. Also, there is increasing recognition that data analysis skills are helpful in many other professional sectors.

Taking this course meets the eligibility criterion to apply for the [University of Manchester Q-Step summer internships](https://www.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/q-step/internships/).
