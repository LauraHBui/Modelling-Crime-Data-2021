## Grammar of Graphics

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

Today we learn the basics of data visualization in `R` using a package called `ggplot2` within the `tidyverse`, one of the most popular packages for making high-quality, reproducible graphics. The framework on which `ggplot2` is based derives from [Hadley Wickham’s (2010) A Layered Grammar of Graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf). 

Wickham advances the work of *Grammar of Graphics* by proposing a layered approach to describe and build graphics in a structured manner. Layers, according to Wickham, are used to describe any graphic or visualization. Every layer comprises five parts, and the three primary ones are (1) the data, (2) the aesthetics, and (3) the geometric objects:

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
</div>

1.	Data: usually the data frame with tidy rows and columns. 
<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
</div>

2.	Aesthetics: the visual characteristics that represent the data, or variables. At its simplest, these could be an x- and y-axis, and can extend to other aesthetics like colour, size, and shape, which are mapped to variables. 
<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
</div>

3.	Geometric objects: also known as ‘geoms’ and represent the data points in the visualisation, such as dots or lines.

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>

Why is this important? Visualizing your data helps you to have a better understanding of them before moving on to more advanced and complex analyses. Numbers themselves can be deceptive and complicated, so by visualizing them, you can identify any patterns or anomalies.

<div style="margin-bottom:70px;">
</div>

### Activity 1: Getting Ready

Before we ‘layer up’, let’s do the following:
<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
</div>

1.	Open up your existing `R `project like you had learned last week
<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
</div>

2.	Load the `gglot2` and  `readr`  packages using the `library()` function. If you haven't already installed these packages, you will need to do so first, using the `install.packages()` function. *If you are unclear about the difference between these two - ask now!!!*
<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
</div>

3.	Download two data sets from Blackboard, under data for this week. Load the two datasets containing crime data from Greater Manchester, England, (gmp_2017.csv and gmp_monthly_2017.csv) using the `read_csv()` function into two different dataframe objects. Respectively name the data frames `burglary_df` and `monthly_df` by using the `<-` assignment operator.  Make sure the data sets are saved within your project directory. If this is the case, we can use the `here()` function to tell R where to find the datasets. In our case to import the datasets, specifying the working directory with `here()`. In our case, you can see we've saved the data files in a folder called Datasets *inside* our project directory. 

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>

Load libraries

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(here)
```

Create first dataframe object, `burglary_df` and load into it the gmp_2017.csv data file.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# gmp_2017.csv
burglary_df <- read_csv(here("Datasets", "gmp_2017.csv"))


```

Create the second dataframe object, `monthly_df` and load into it the gmp_monthly_2017.csv data file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
monthly_df <- read_csv(here("Datasets", "gmp_monthly_2017.csv"))

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

You should have two dataframe objects in your environment now. How many rows are in burglary_df? what about in monthly_df? How many variables?

## ggplot2

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

This week we will be learning how to use R to create all sorts of exciting data visualisations. You may remember some of the key principles of data visualisations from last semester, around these being truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening. Also remember accessible!

Here is a recent very powerful visualisation from The New York Times about deaths from COVID-19 in the USA: 

![https://twitter.com/beccapfoley/status/1363338950518206472](Images/times_COVID_VIZ.jpeg)

R has amazing data visualisation qualitites. It is used more and more frequently by professionals and academics to create data visualisations which are truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening.

Read this article about how the BBC use R to create their graphics: [How the BBC Visual and Data Journalism team works with graphics in R](https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535)

![How the BBC Visual and Data Journalism team works with graphics in R](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*DDRU1L5LIJkgDBxd.png)

As you learn to create graphs in `ggplot2`, you will see that the code reflects building these graphs as layers. This will take getting used to if you are only familiar with building graphs from a template in Excel. You can also reuse chunks of code to create different kinds of graphics or identical ones in other datasets. Today we focus on the `ggplot2` package to learn our three substantive topics: **layers**, **graphs for categorical data**, and **graphs for numeric data**. 

<div style="margin-bottom:70px;">
</div>

#### Activity 2: Getting to Know New Data

Before we dive into those topics, we need to get into the habit of getting to know our data. First, here is a brief data dictionary for both. 


**burglary_df** has 8 variables: 

- LSOAcode: LSOA stands for Lower Super Output Area, and is a statistical unit of geography - it represents neighbourhoods of about 3-400 households each. So here we can think that LSOA means neighbourhood.
- burglary_count: the number of burglaries in each LSOA in 2017
- LAname: the name of the Local Authority that the LSOA falls into
- IMD score: the IMD refers to the Index of Multiple Deprivation. This is a measure which combines seven domains of deprivation into one index: income, employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing/services, and living environment. You can read about it more here: [IMD infigraphic](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/833959/IoD2019_Infographic.pdf). IMD score is the score that particular LSOA has on this measure. 
- IMDrank: this is a variable that ranks all 32,844 Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) from highest to lowest on this measure of IMD.
- IMDdeci: this tells you what decile of deprivation the LSOA falls into. 
- incscore: this is the score for income deprivation, one of the 7 indicators of deprivation which makes up the IMD
- LSOAname: the name of the Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs)
- pop: the population who live in the Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs)

**monthly_df** has 3 variables: 

- Month: month of the year where 1 = January and 12 = December
- crime_type: the type of crime (from police.uk categories see here: [download police.uk data categories vs home office offence codes](https://www.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/police-uk/media/downloads/crime-categories/police-uk-category-mappings.csv))
- n: the number of crimes of each type in each month in 2017

Have a look at both data sets. Let us use the function `View()` first. What do you think are the levels of measurement for each variable? Make a note of this. 

Now use the the function `class()` to look at how `R` treats each variable for each dataset. How does this match with what you think is the level of measurement for each bariable? Keep this in mind!

<!-- In `burglary_df`, there are eight variables. For example, the `IMDscore` variable combines seven domains of deprivation into one index: income, employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing/services, and living environment. `IMDrank` is a variable that ranks all 32,844 Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) from highest to lowest.  -->

<!-- What are LSOAs? They are small geographical areas developed from census information in order to calculate a range of statistics on neighbourhoods. You will see that by using the `range()` function (`range(burglary_df$IMDrank)`), that not all LSOAs are included, as this dataset only contains cases from Greater Manchester.  -->

**Note: **In `monthly_df`, there are three variables. There is a lot of information in this data frame as there are crime counts for various different crimes, spread across each month of the year. Note that the data are in *long format*. This is a useful and typical format for longitudinal data because our time variable (i.e., months) is contained in one variable. This will make it easier to create graphics showing change over time.

When you read a good quantitative research paper, its methods section will state the number of cases analysed with n = , whereby ‘n’ represents ‘number of cases’. This is known as sample size. For example, if the sample size of a study is two-hundred, the methods section would state it as ‘n= 200’.

In your group google doc, type out the following: the number of entries (cases) for each dataframe. Type out the number following n = . In addition, state what you think the unit of analysis is in each dataframe.

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

## Today’s 3 
<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

Now that we have gotten to know our data, onto our three main topics: **layers**, **graphs for nominal and ordinal data**, and **graphs for interval and ratio data**. 


---

### Layers
<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

To understand layers and how they are generated in `ggplot2`, we begin with a scatterplot. This is a graph that shows the relationship between two continuous variables – in other words, between two numeric variables. 


For example, we may be interested to find out whether there is a relationship between area-level income deprivation and burglaries. Are areas with higher income deprivation score burgled more? Maybe less money to spend on security systems, so easier access means that there are mode burglaries in the neighbourhood? Or is it areas with lower income deprivation score more burgled? Maybe as these areas are known for being well off, they become targets because once a burglar gains entry, they can make off with many valuable items. To visualise this relationship, we will build up a scatterplot, layer by layer. 




<div style="margin-bottom:70px;">
</div>

#### Activity 3: Using ggplot2 to Create a Scatterplot

Our research question, therefore, is: *What is the relationship between income and burglary counts?* 

Let's use a ggplot (grammar of graphics plot) to answer this. First, load up the package, `ggplot2` which has all the functions we'll be using: 

```{r,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

```

Following the grammar of graphics layered approach, let us first make the data layer. To do this, we take the `ggplot()` function, and inside it, we put our object, which contains our data. To let the function know this is the data, we can also write `data =` before it.

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>

```{r}

ggplot(data = burglary_df)

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

The *Plots* window will appear and will be blank, like what you see above. We've told R what data we want to plot, but we are yet to specify what variables we want across our X and Y axis, or other fields. To do this, we will need `aesthetics`. 

The second layer is the aesthetics. Recall that these are about mapping the visual properties. Since our research question is about the relationship between income (`incscore`) and burglary count (`burglary_count`), we will map these variables to the x and y axes. We specify the aesthetics inside the `aes()` function (**aes**thetics), indicating which variable we want on the x axis (`x = `) and which one on the y axis (`y =`). 

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>

```{r}

ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = incscore, y = burglary_count))

```




<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

You will now see an update in the *Plots* window! It shows the axis and the break labels. R now knows that we want to plot the income variable on our x axis, and the burglary count variable on the y. The labels are currently applied automatically, we will come to how you can change these yourself later. 


But first, let's see how to finally put our data on the plot. To do this, we must assign a **geometry**

The last layer is the geometric object, or geometry, layer. It has numerous functions, each beginning with the argument `geom_`. To create our scatterplot, we use the function `geom_point()` . 

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = incscore, y = burglary_count)) +
  geom_point()

# We are saying, ‘Hey R, may you please make me a graphic using the data "burglary_df” and map the variables “incscore” to the x-axis and “burglary_count” to the y-axis, then pass this information through (using “ + ” ) to make a scatterplot?’

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>


Now the scatterplot in all its glory appears. What can you say about the relationship between deprivation and burglary victimisation? In your group google doc, type out what you think is the relationship between these two variables.

---

<div style="margin-bottom:70px;">
</div>

#### Activity 4: Adding a Third Variable to a Scatterplot

The real power in layered graphics comes from the ability to keep piling on the layers and layers and layers. For example, we might think: Maybe it would be helpful if we included other information like how local authorities may play a role in this relationship. Maybe income is positively associated with burglaries in one local authority, let's say Bolton, but not in another, let's say Bury. Toexplore this, we might want to colour each point by the variable `LAname` using the `colour` argument: 

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = incscore, y = burglary_count, colour = LAname)) + 
  geom_point()

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

In your group google doc, state what you observe from this new visual. What sort of relationship does it seem to show between burglary counts and income? Do you think local authority plays a role? Do note the default colours, and think back to what we learned about accessibility last semester. In the next activity, we will address this!

---


As previously mentioned, a number of other functions are available for the `geom_` function such as shape, linetype, size, fill, and alpha (transparency). But these depend on the geometry being used and the class of variable being mapped to the aesthetic. For example, try the shape aesthetic for `LAname`, which will vary the shape of each point according to local authority (hint: replace `colour =` with `shape = `). A warning message appears – what is it telling you? How can you see this reflected on the plot?

This relates to the grammar of graphics philosophy on how people understand information, and `ggplot2` will warn you when it thinks the graphic is difficult to interpret or, worse, misleading. 

<div style="margin-bottom:70px;">
</div>

---


#### Activity 5: Colours!
The colour palette that appeared for our previous scatterplot is a default one, and there are a number of default colour palettes available. We can specify a colour palette using an additional layer with the function `scale_color_brewer()`. For example:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r} 

ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = incscore, y = burglary_count, color = LAname)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Spectral")

```


Is this looking familiar? Last semester we utilised the website [colorbrewer2.org/](https://colorbrewer2.org/). The `scale_colour_brewer()` function takes palettes from this resource, and applies them to your charts. 


<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

In addition, the `viridis` package has a number of colour palettes that consider colour blindness where readers are unable to differentiate colours on the graphic. It is already integrated into `ggplot2`, so there is no need to install it separately. For example, we take the previous code and replace the last line with a viridis colour palette for categorical variables:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = incscore, y = burglary_count, color = LAname)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_viridis_d() # or scale_color_viridis_c() for a continuous variable 

```

<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

Now we have built up a graph to visualise the bivatiate relationship between income deprivation score and burglary count per neighbourhood. Then, we parachuted ahead to introduce a 3rd variable (moving into multivariable analysis) and introduced colour to add the local authority into the mix. In the upcoming exercises, we will learn how to tweak the charts, to make them even more so our own!

<div style="margin-bottom:70px;">
</div>

---


#### Activity 6: Sizes & Transparency
Recall that the geometric object layer is about the data points themselves. You can change their appearance within the `geom_point` function. To increase the size of the points and make them transparent, we use the size and alpha arguments. The default for size is 1, so anything lower than 1 will make points smaller while anything larger than 1 will make the points bigger. The default for alpha is also 1, which means total opaqueness, so you can only go lower to make things more transparent. For example:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

#Below, we want our data points to be a bit bigger ( 3 ) and more transparent ( 0.5 ) than the default

ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = incscore, y = burglary_count, color = LAname)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral")

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>


---


#### Activity 7: Labels
The graphic is looking good, but the labels will need tweaking if we do not like the default ones, which are our variable names. We use the `labs()` function to change the labels for the x and y axes as well as the graphic title:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = incscore, y = burglary_count, color = LAname)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral") + 
  labs(x = "Income score", y = "Burglary count", title = "Income and burglary and victimization", color = "Local Authority")

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

---

#### Activity 8: Built-in Themes
A final touch to your graphic can be the use of **themes**. These change the overall appearance of your graphic. The default theme we have for our graphic is `theme_gray()`, but we can go for a minimalist look by using `theme_minimal ()`. There are a number of these customised themes like one that is inspired by *The Economist* ( `theme_economist ()` )

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# Changing graphic to the minimal theme with the last line of code
ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = incscore, y = burglary_count, color = LAname)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral") + 
  labs(x = "Income score", y = "Burglary count", title = "Income and burglary and victimization", caption = "Income score from 2019 IMD. Burglary counts from 2017." , color = "Local Authority") + 
  theme_minimal()


```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

---



### Graphs for Categorical Data

<div style="margin-bottom:70px;">
</div>

#### Activity 9: Bar graphs
<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

To explore the count distribution of categoriacal variables, use the bar graph. We may be interested to know the number of neighbourhoods falling into each indice of multiple deprivation (IMD) decile, a key indicator of criminality. Those in decile 1 are within the most deprived 10% of LSOAs nationally; those in decile 10 are considered within the least deprived 10% of LSOAs nationally.

The variable of interest, `IMDdeci`, is classed as numeric but we will need to treat it as a factor or else the default x-axis will include non-integer values like 7.5 . 

Instead of making a new object, `ggplot` can calculate these frequencies by only specifying the x-axis and using the function `as.factor()`:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

ggplot(data = burglary_df) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = as.factor(IMDdeci))) + # convert IMDdeci to a factor with as.factor 
  labs(x = "Deprivation Score", y = "Number of Lower Super Output Areas")

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>


#### *Grouped Bar Graphs*

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>

If we are interested in the distribution of deprivation like the previous bar graph but would like to see it by local authority, we can use the grouped bar graph, and specify the colour with the `fill = ` parameter inside the `aes()` function. But do think back to what we learned last semester, about row and column percentages, and how in bovariate analysis it is important to make decisions that will affect how our readers will interpret our data. For example, in this case, if we take an example filling the colour of each bar by local authority, we get a chart like this: 



<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# the ‘dodge’ position means that the bars avoid or ‘dodge’ each other
ggplot(data = burglary_df) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = as.factor(IMDdeci), fill = LAname), position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
  labs(x = "Deprivation Score", y = "Number of Lower Super Output Areas", fill = "Local Authority")


```


How do the different local authorities compare in terms of the distribution of deprived neighbourhoods? It can be a bit tough to say. But what about if we flip these: 

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# the ‘dodge’ position means that the bars avoid or ‘dodge’ each other
ggplot(data = burglary_df) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = LAname, fill = as.factor(IMDdeci)), position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
  labs(x = "Local Authority", y = "Number of Lower Super Output Areas", fill = "Deprivation Score")


```

<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

A little more clear, no? 

In your google doc, state what you observe from the bar graph and grouped bar graph depicting the relationship between deprivation and LSOAs.



**Note**: you might have noticed, inside the `geom_bar()` function, after the closing bracket of the `aes()` function, the parameter `, position = "stack"`. This means that we get a *stacked* bar chart. You could change this to `, position = "dodge"`, which would give you a clustered bar chart. Like so: 


<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# the ‘dodge’ position means that the bars avoid or ‘dodge’ each other
ggplot(data = burglary_df) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = LAname, fill = as.factor(IMDdeci)), position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
  labs(x = "Local Authority", y = "Number of Lower Super Output Areas", fill = "Deprivation Score")


```


This might also be another way to display your data. What is the advantage of this clustered bar chart? What is the advantage of the stacked? Both have pros and cons, think about what each one shows and hides!

---


#### *Multiple Bar Graphs*

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
Another useful visual is multiple bar graphs. This creates different plots for each level of a factor instead of putting lots of information into one graphic. Using the `facet_wrap ()` layer, we make the information obtained from the previous scatterplot, where we coloured in each point by local authority, clearer. 

Although the scatterplot uses numeric variables, we use this information by local authority, and `LAname` is classed as factor:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# To facet the scatterplot by local authority, ‘ ~ ‘ is used next to ‘LAname’
ggplot(data = burglary_df) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = incscore, y = burglary_count)) + 
  facet_wrap(~LAname)

# By default, facet_wrap fixes the y-axis of each graph to make comparisons easier

```

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>

It is important to choose an appropriate graph, so thought is required. May the following graphic be fair warning:

![](Images/barplots.jpg)


---


### Graphs for Numeric Data
<div style="margin-bottom:70px;">
</div>


#### Activity 10: Histograms
Histograms differ from scatterplots because they require only one numeric variable and they create bins, visualised as bars, to count the frequency of each bar. We create a histogram of the variable `IMDscore`, the overall score of deprivation in each neighbourhood:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = IMDscore)) + 
  geom_histogram()

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

How the histogram looks, and therefore, the conclusions drawn from the visual, are sensitive to the number of **bins**. You should try different specifications of the bin-width until you find one that tells the complete and concise story of the data. Specifying the size of bins is done using the argument `bin_width`; the default size is 30 and you can change this to get a rougher or a more granular idea:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

# Using bin-width of 1 we are essentially creating a bar for every increase in level of deprivation
ggplot(data = burglary_df, mapping = aes(x = IMDscore)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

```
<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

Play around with the bin widths to find which one looks the most visually comprehensible. In your google doc, state what bin width you think does the job, and why.

<div style="margin-bottom:70px;">
</div>

---


#### Activity 11: Line Graphs
A very good way of visualizing trends over time are line graphs. For this, let us use the `monthly_df` data frame. Ensure it is loaded into your environment. Have a look at the structure of these data to get to know them. 

The data is in long format: we have a single month variable for 12 months’ worth of data (rather than one variable or column for each month). Setting longitudinal data up in long format allows us to specify the aesthetics (e.g., x- and y-axes) easily.

For a line graph, we use the function `geom_line()`. We plan to plot the counts to show the trends of different crimes over the course of the year. Our time variable, `month`, should run along the x-axis, and the count variable, `n`, should run on the y-axis. 

To show each crime type separately, we use the group aesthetic and a new aesthetic, `linetype`, which uses different patterns for each group. To show our time measurement points, we also add `geom_point ()`: 

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

ggplot(data = monthly_df, aes(x = as.factor(Month), y = n, group = crime_type, linetype = crime_type)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()

# We are saying, ‘Hey R, may you please make a graphic using the data frame “monthly_df”, and map the variable “month” (turning it into a factor) to the x-axis and “n” to the y-axis, and group this information by “crime_type”, showing different patterns for each crime type, then pass this information through (“ +”) to make a line graph, and pass this information through (“ +”) to make a scatterplot of the time points too?’

```

<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

Now, in your google doc, state what you observe from this line graph on different crimes throughout the months.

#### Activity 12: Boxplots

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>

If you want more information about your data than a histogram can give, a box (and whisker) plot may be what you are looking for. A boxplot visualizes the minimum, maximum, interquartile range, the median, and any unusual observations - your 5-number summary!

For this example, we return to the `burglary_df` data, and focus on the distribution of burglary counts. In addition, we make a boxplot for *each* deprivation decile to show how LSOAs in the most deprived deciles often have higher median burglary counts. 

We send all of this information, the boxplots, into one object called `my_whisker_plot`, to which we can return in case:

<div style="margin-bottom:35px;">
</div>
```{r}

my_whisker_plot <- ggplot(data = burglary_df) + 
geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = as.factor(IMDdeci), y = burglary_count, group = as.factor(IMDdeci), fill = as.factor(IMDdeci))) 

my_whisker_plot + 
  labs(x = "Deprivation Scale", y = "Number of Burglaries")

```

<div style="margin-bottom:50px;">
</div>

In your group google doc, state what you observe from your newly created boxplot.

## SUMMARY
<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

Today was about using a popular package called `ggplot2` for effectively visualizing data. We learn this because it is important to understand our data before embarking on more complex analyses. If we do not understand our data beforehand, we risk misinterpreting what the data are trying to tell us. The package is based on this approach called *Grammar of Graphics*, which proposes a 'grammar' to describe and construct statistical graphics. The package, however, sees the creation of data visuals accomplished through **layers**. 

Our first topic we learned was about these layers, specifically data, aesthetics, and geometric objects. As a final touch, **themes** changed the overall appearance of your graphic. Our second and third topics introduced us to **graphs** that we can use for all types of variables, and how to create them in `ggplot2`. One example was the histogram, whereby adjusting the width of the **bins** helped for better interpretation of the data.
