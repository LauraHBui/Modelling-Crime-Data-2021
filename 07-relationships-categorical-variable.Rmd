## Associating with Categorical Variables



We are familiar with categorical variables. They have a nominal or ordinal level of measurement, and can be binary -- have only two possible values. In `R`, these variables are encoded as a factor class, and for shorthand, are referred to as *factors*. (See Lesson 2, section 2.4.1.1 .) 

In inferential statistics, sometimes we want to make predictions about relationships with factors. For example, we want to understand the relationship between sex and fear of crime. Perhaps we think males will have lower levels of fear of crime than females would have. The variable, sex, in this case, is a binary factor with the two categories, male and female, whereas fear of crime is a numeric variable. 

Today, we learn how to conduct more inferential statistical analyses, but specifically with categorical variables. 

<br>

### Activity 1: Our `R` prep routine

Before we start, we do the following:

1. Open up our existing `R` project

<br>
2. Install and load the required packages listed above
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(effsize)
library(forcats)
library(gmodels)
library(ggplot2)
library(haven)
library(here)
library(labelled)
library(psych)
library(skimr)
library(vcdExtra)
```


3. Download from Blackboard and load into `R` the British Crime Survey (BCS) dataset (*bcs_2007_8_teaching_data_unrestricted.dta* ). Be mindful of its data format because it will require certain codes and packages. Name this data frame `BCS0708`. 

<br>
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
BCS0708 <- read_dta(here("Datasets", "bcs_2007_8_teaching_data_unrestricted.dta"))

```


4.	Get to know the data with the `View()` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
View(BCS0708)
```

## Today’s 3

We further our understanding of inferential statistics by learning more about variables and a couple of new statistical analyses that examine a relationship with factor variables. Our three topics today are: **independent and dependent variables**, the **t-test**, and the **chi-square**. 


 
---

### Independent and Dependent Variables

When setting hypotheses, we primarily wanted to know whether there was a relationship between certain variables. Inadvertently, we also were arranging our variables in a way that indicated one was the explanation and the other was the outcome. 

Using our previous example on sex and fear of crime, we can arrange them so that sex is the **independent variable** (IV or $X$), indicating that it is presumed to have an impact on the level of fear of crime, the **dependent variable** (DV or $Y$), considered to be influenced by $X$. 

We believe that sex ($X$) has an influence on level of fear of crime ($Y$), and hypothesise, based on previous research, that males will have lower levels of fear of crime than females. We then select a sample, collect our data from that sample, and conduct an appropriate statistical test to find out whether our hypothesis holds. 

<!-- Although independent and dependent variables are not terms usually used for today’s analyses, we will use them to indicate which variable plays the role of explanation and which plays the part of outcome. In addition, it is good to get into the mindset of arranging your variables as such. This helps to clarify how your variables will relate to each other.  -->

An important point to remember is that, although the independent variable (IV) is considered to influence the dependent variable (DV), it *does not mean the IV causes the DV*. We can only arrange these variables in the direction we think is suitable and make statements about whether they are related to or *correlated* with each other. 

This idea of 'cause' is referred to as *causal inference* and is, in itself, a whole area of research, as establishing causal relationships is not an easy task. One approach we have covered and made reference to throughout your data analysis and research methods classes is to use experimental research designs, such as randomised control trials. If you are interested in causal inference, Scott Cunningham's [Causal Inference Mixtape](https://www.scunning.com/mixtape.html) is highly recommended. Nevertheless, for the kinds of analysis we will be doing in this class, it is best to keep in mind that correlation *does not mean* causation. 

<br>
<br>

### Comparing means: the t-test

When assessing the relationship between a binary, categorical variable and a numeric variable, we usually summarise the numeric variable for each category of the categorical variable in order to compare. For example, we are interested in fear of crime and how levels of it vary between sexes. For this, we have two relevant variables in our data frame `BCS0708`: `sex` and `tcviolent`. Let us have a look: 
<br>

```{r}

attributes(BCS0708$sex)

# Any missing values?
table(is.na(BCS0708$sex))

```
<br>

We can see that the first variable, `sex`, takes the values of '1' for 'male' and '2' for 'female'. This variable should be classed as a factor, in `R` speak, so let us recode `sex` so that it is classed as so: 
<br>

```{r}

# As is, 'sex' is classed as 'haven-labelled', which is incorrect, so we change it to its correct class, factor:

BCS0708$sex <- as_factor(BCS0708$sex)

```
<br>

Now we check out our other variable of interest, `tcviolent`:
<br>

```{r}

attributes(BCS0708$tcviolent)

# Any missing values?
table(is.na(BCS0708$tcviolent)) # Yes, there is!

```
<br>

The variable, `tcviolent`, represents 'respondent level of worry about being a victim of personal crime (high score = high worry)'. This is a numeric variable and measures fear of crime.

<br>

#### Activity 2: Exploring our data with descriptive statistics

Before conducting further tests, let us do some *exploratory data analysis* by getting to know our variables of interest. We use the function `summarise()` to examine the variable `sex` and use the function `n()` to obtain frequencies:
<br>

```{r}

# Examining distribution of sex variable
BCS0708 %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(n = n())

```
<br>


The output displays `r BCS0708 %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% filter(sex == "male") %>% pull(n)` males and `r BCS0708 %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% filter(sex == "female") %>% pull(n)` females. 

Now for our dependent variable `tcviolent`: we use the `skim()` function from the `skimr` package introduced in Lesson 4:
<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE}

skim(BCS0708, tcviolent)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::kable(skim(BCS0708, tcviolent))

```
<br>

Then we get to know the data further by checking out the dependent variable, `tcviolent`, by the independent variable `sex`. We can do so with the `describeBy` function from the `psych` package, which produces summary statistics by group:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Use the with() function too to specify the data frame:
with(BCS0708, describeBy(tcviolent, sex))

```
<br>

From the output, it seems that males have a lower average fear of crime than females do, specifically a difference of a score of 0.602. The difference between the medians is even larger: 0.669. 

In addition, we can visualise a five-number summary with boxplots (see Lesson 3, section 3.3.3.3):
<br>

```{r}

ggplot(BCS0708, aes (x = tcviolent, group = sex, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_bw() 


```
<br>

Note that these descriptive statistics are only about our sample; we actually want to make inferences about our population of interest -- all males and females in England and Wales. So, we use inferential statistics; our observation of a difference between means prompts us to test whether this difference is an actual difference, or if it is attributed to chance.

Hence, our hypothesis is that, in the population, there is a difference in the mean level for fear of crime for males compared to said levels for females. 

<!-- What we want then is a **difference-in-means** estimator. That is, we want to estimate the difference in means between the two groups in our population, from our sample. For this, we can use two-sample tests, based on a difference in means estimator to investigate our null hypothesis that the means are equal between the two populations.  -->

Our non-directional hypothesis has to do with our research question of whether there is a difference in the amount of fear of crime between males and females. We test our hypothesis using the **t-test**, which relies on Student's *t* distribution.

<!--Let us now look at the mean, standard deviation, and variance: 
<br>

```{r}

# We tell R to obtain the three descriptive statistics and 'round' the values to one decimal place

# Remember, we must add 'na.rm = TRUE' as we have missing values or else this will display 'NA'

BCS0708 %>% group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(mean_worry = round(mean(tcviolent, na.rm = TRUE),1), 
            sd_worry = round(sd(tcviolent, na.rm = TRUE),1), 
            var_worry = round(var(tcviolent, na.rm = TRUE),1))

```
<br>

The mean for females is higher than that of males, and we have quite high dispersion too, as indicated by the variance. We observe how scores from `tcviolent` might differ between sexes in the variable `sex`. -->
<br>

---

#### Student's *t* distribution

In previous weeks, we used the standard deviation (SD) of our sample to estimate the standard error (SE). (See Lesson 5, section 5.2.2 .) This approach works reasonably well when applied to large samples. With small samples, however, using the SD as an estimate of the SE is problematic. 

The reason is that the SD varies from sample to sample, so this variation in smaller samples makes for more uncertainty. In addition, we are likely not to know the true population values, our parameters. For such a case, William Gosset, [Statistician and Head Brewer for Guinness,](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gosset/) (see also recommended reading) suggested that we needed to use a different probability distribution, **Student's *t* distribution**. Gosset had developed this distribution (under his pen name 'Student') so that he could make meaningful predictions using small samples of barley instead of large ones -- a cost-effective method.

<!--The *t* distribution and the normal distribution are nearly indistinguishable for large samples. This has implications for, say, the calculation of the margin of error. For large samples, you would still multiply the value (from dividing the SD by the square root of the sample size) by 1.96:

<br>
1.96*{sd}/{\sqrt{n}}$

<br>

With smaller sample sizes, though, that value will differ for different distributions (e.g., z-distribution or a t-distribution).

<br>

> *In order to use the t-distribution, however, we need to assume the data were randomly sampled and that the population distribution is unimodal and symmetric.* 
<br>

In fact, this is probably a good time to engage with our assumptions made by the t-test. -->
<br>

#### Assumptions of the t-test

The t-test makes a number of assumptions, and to use this test, all assumptions should be met:

1. *Two means or proportions will be compared*: our independent variable is binary, signifying two groups, and the dependent variable is a numeric variable (OR a binary variable for comparision of proportions, but this requires a large sample size). 

2. *The sampling method was independent random sampling*. We will proceed as if this assumption is met.

3. *Normal distribution is assumed for both populations* (from which the two groups come from): because the t-test makes assumptions about the shape of the distribution, it is considered a **parametric test**. Tests that do not make this assumption about shape are called non-parametric. This assumption, however, can be relaxed if the sample size for both groups are large (and why proportions can be compared).

You may also want to check for outliers by plotting the data. Outliers may distort your results, particularly with smaller samples. All assumptions with the exception of the second one are met. To meet the second assumption, you can check if your data are normally distributed if the sample size is not large:
<br>

```{r}

ggplot(BCS0708, aes(x = tcviolent, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()

```
<br>

The density plots provide a visual tool for assessing the *unimodality* -- a single, clear peak indicating a most frequent value -- and the symmetry of the distribution. Later, we will discuss a more elaborate graphical tool for assessing the normality, the normal probability plot. For now, let us assume that this is adequate to compute the t-test.

4. *The variances of both samples are equal to each other*. We test for this in the next section.
<!--The BCS uses a complex survey design which would require the use of special procedures for hypothesis testing. However, those special procedures are well beyond the scope of this course and would typically be covered in more advanced courses. Therefore, for convenience -->


For an independent sample t-test, however, an additional assumption must be met: 

5. *The two groups must be independent of each other*: This assumption of independence would be violated if, for example, one group comprised women and the other group, their partners. If this were the case, the resulting values for both groups would be related. If this assumption is violated, we would need the dependent t-test, which will be covered later.

<br>

#### Independent Sample t-test

<!--In one of this lesson's lecture videos, different types of t-tests were mentioned. One-sample t-tests are not covered in this class, but two other types are: independent (or unpaired) and dependent (or paired) sample t-tests. -->

In our example, we would like to know whether there is a difference between the mean score for fear of crime, as embodied in the variable `tcviolent`, between males and females. We fulfilled three assumptions for the **independent sample t-test** or *unpaired t-test*. This t-test compares two groups that are independent of one another. It suggests that the values for the dependent variable in one sample are not reliant on the values for the dependent variable in the other sample. In our case, levels of fear of crime for females and males are not related to one another, so the fifth assumption is met. 

In addition to our research question which asks whether there is a difference in the amount of fear of crime between males and females, our null and alternative hypotheses are:

<br>
$H_0$: There is no significant difference in fear of crime between males and females. 

<br>
$H_A$: There is a significant difference in fear of crime between males and females.

<br>
 
##### Activity 3: Testing for equality of variance

We must meet the fouth assumption by conducting the **test for equality of variance**, also known as **Levene's test**. Conducting this specific test is an important step before the t-test. This is an F-test that evaluates the null hypothesis that the variances of the two groups are equal. When we want to compare variances, we conduct this test as the variances may affect how we specify our t-test. If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, then we have met this assumption. 
<br>

```{r}

# DV comes first in code, then the IV
var.test(BCS0708$tcviolent ~ BCS0708$sex)

```
<br>

The information to focus on in the output are the alternative hypothesis, the F-statistic, and associated p-value. The alternative hypothesis states that the variances are not equal to 1, meaning they are not equal to each other. The p-value is very small, so we reject the null hypothesis that the variances are equal to each other. Thus, we have violated this assumption of equal variances, so we must address this. 

One way to do so, and is familiar to one of the lesson's lecture videos, is to use the `t.test()` function. There, you can specify whether the equality of variance assumption is met. In our case, we must set `var.equal` to `FALSE` in the following independent sample t-test as the assumption is violated. 

<br>
<br>

---

##### Activity 4: Conducting an independent sample t-test

It is now time to carry out our t-test. We use the `t.test()` function, which performs both the one and two sample t-tests on vectors of data. It can also perform paired and independent samples t-tests by modifying the `paired=` argument. We include our dependent and our independent variables, separated by a tilda (`~`), and set the `var.equal` argument to `FALSE`:
<br>

``` {r}

# Run the t-test with var.equal option set to false as assumption was violated:
t.test(BCS0708$tcviolent ~ BCS0708$sex, var.equal = FALSE)

# You can save your results in an object, too, to refer back to later:
t_test_results <- t.test(BCS0708$tcviolent ~ BCS0708$sex, var.equal = FALSE)

# Print independent t-test results 
t_test_results

```
<br>

From the output, focus on: the means, alternative hypothesis ($H_A$), the t-statistics, the p-value, and the 95% confidence interval (CI). 

First, the means show that males score an average score of -0.2738322 on this fear of crime measure, while females score an average of 0.3281656 - this is the same output we got from exploring our data previously. 

Second, the alternative hypothesis is not equal to 0, which is what we expect if there is no difference between the two groups. 

Third, the t-statistic reports `r t_test_results$statistic` with an associated p-value which much smaller than our $\alpha$ = 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis that the difference in the population is 0. We can say that there is a *statistically significant* difference between fear of crime for males and females in England and Wales. We can also state that, given the null hypothesis, there is a < .001 chance of observing the difference that we have actually observed (or one more unlikely).

Fourth, the 95% CI allows us to make an estimate that tells us the value of the difference in means in the population. From our sample, we estimate that the difference in fear of crime scores between sexes is somewhere between 0.56 and 0.64 points. 

Is this considered a large or small difference? In many cases, interpreting this is challenging because it can be subjective or the scale that was used to measure the variable is the original, raw version. To help us answer our question of size difference, we will need to include a measure of effect size.
<br>
<br>

---

##### Activity 5: Considering the effect size- Cohen's d


We can always look at **standardised measures of the effect size**. There are a number of them. They aim to give you a sense of how large the difference is by using a standardised metric. The value indicating the strength of relationship is known as the **effect size**, and simply quantifies the magnitude of difference between two variables. 

We will use one of the measures, **Cohen's d**, for this example. We can obtain it with the `cohen.d()` function from the `effsize` package:
<br>

```{r}

cohen.d(BCS0708$tcviolent ~ BCS0708$sex)

```
<br>

Cohen suggested a general guideline to interpret this effect size as an absolute value: 0.2 to 0.3 is considered a 'small' effect; around 0.5, a 'medium' effect; and 0.8 and larger, a 'large' effect. The output suggests that the observed difference is a medium effect size. 

<!--However, keep in mind these rules are not absolute. In some fields of research and in relation to some problems the rules of thumb may be slightly different. You need, in professional practice, to be alert to those nuances by being familiar to the rules that other researchers use in your particular area of work.-->

To communicate the results obtained from our descriptive statistics, the t-test, and Cohen's *d*, we could write something like the following: 

<br>

>'On average, males have a lower score of fear of crime (M=-.27, SE=.01) than females (M=.33, SE=.02). Using an alpha level of 0.05, this difference was significant (t=-29.11, p<.001) and corresponds to a medium-sized effect  (d=-0.63).'

<br>

Communicating this way is similar to the way findings are communicated in the 'Results' section of academic papers.

<!--In your "Conclusions" you would need to discuss what the theoretical or practical implications of this finding are; connecting it to existing theoretical debates. 

One important thing to remember is that when doing hypothesis testing there is always the possibility of error. Our statements are probabilistic. We could be rejecting the null hypothesis when we shouldn't (false positive or Type I error), if we are using an alpha level of .05 this may happen 5% of the time, or we may fail to reject the null hypothesis when we should (false negative or Type II error).-->

<br>
<br>

---

#### Dependent Sample t-test


Previously, we went through the assumptions of an independent sample t-test. If we had violated the fifth assumption, we would need to use the dependent sample t-test instead. When we are interested in comparing means of two groups that are related to each other, the **dependent sample t-test** or *paired sample t-test* is appropriate. What this means is that the responses are paired together because there is a prior connection between them. For example, we have two groups where the first one comprises test scores before an intervention and the second one comprises test scores after that intervention of the same people from the first group. The scores are connected to each other because they belong to the same people.


##### Activity 6: Conducting a dependent sample t-test

Let us create a familiar synthetic data of a hypothetical intervention for at-risk youth in Manchester. We have identified 100 at-risk young people and exposed them to an intervention designed to stop them from reoffending. Both before and after the intervention, though, we ask them to take a test that measures their compliance with the law.
<br>

```{r}


set.seed(1999) # Ensuring results are the same for you and me

# Making this sythentic data of at-risk youth
df <- data.frame(subject_id = c(1:100, 1:100), 
                 prepost = c(rep("pre", 100), rep("post", 100)),
                 compliance_score = c(rnorm(100, 30, 10), rnorm(100, 60, 14)))


```
<br>

We now have our data frame called `df`, which contains 200 observations (our young people) and their scores on the compliance test taken before and after the intervention. This can be seen as *two waves* of a survey; we compare the behaviours of the young people from Wave 1 to Wave 2 to address the research question: ‘Do the compliance scores of the young people change after our intervention?’ Our non-directional null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:

<br>
 

$H_0$: There is no significant difference in the compliance scores between Wave 1 (pre-intervention) and Wave 2 (post-intervention). 

<br>

$H_A$: There is a significant difference in the compliance scores between Wave 1 (pre-intervention) and Wave 2 (post-intervention). 

<br>
 
As responses from both Waves 1 and 2 are required, cases with missing responses from either will be dropped automatically when our analysis is conducted. This t-test also requires the DV to be stored as two separate variables. Assumptions one to three are met, but how about equality of variance?
<br>

```{r}

# DV comes first in code, then the IV
var.test(df$compliance_score ~ df$prepost)

```
<br>

The p-value is less than the alpha level of 0.05. This means that we, again, have unequal variances, so we must specify this in the `var.equal=` argument of the `t.test()` function. We conduct the dependent sample t-test: 
<br>

```{r}

# Use the variables `prepost` indicating whether the answer is from wave 1 (pre-intervention) or wave 2 (post-intervention) and `compliance_score`, the score the young person achieved on the compliance questionnaire. 

# Specify TRUE for the `paired` option 
t.test(compliance_score ~ prepost, data = df, var.equal= FALSE, paired= TRUE)

```
<br>

The results indicate that we can reject the null hypothesis as the p-value is less than $\alpha = 0.05$. We conclude that there is a significant difference in compliance scores before and after our intervention between Wave 1 and Wave 2. The mean difference, 95% of time when repeated samples are taken from the population, will be between 27.39 and 34.14 points. On average, compliance scores were 30.76 points higher than before the intervention. What is the magnitude of this difference?

We, again, use Cohen's *d* to find out. As this is a paired t-test, we must conduct it slightly differently than when we did for the independent t-test. We specify the argument `paired= TRUE` and specify what ID it can use to match our participants in the pre- and post- groups; this is done with the `Subject()` array appended with the `|` operator:
<br>

```{r}

cohen.d(compliance_score ~ prepost | Subject(subject_id), data = df, paired= TRUE)

```

Happy times, this is a statistically significant (so we can generalise) large effect (Cohen's d estimate: 2.520966 (large)). Our intervention seems to be associated with an increased score in compliance in our follow-up questionnaire. But still, beware about inferring causation. There may have been other factors at play (for example, what if they all just aged out of crime, growing older and more compliant). A randomised control trial might help with alleviating these competing explanations...!

 
<br>

### Chi-square


The **chi-square statistic** is a test of statistical significance for two categorical variables. It tells us how much the observed distribution differs from the one expected under the null hypothesis. It is based on the **cross-tabulation** (A.K.A crosstabs) or **contingency table**. These appear as a table that simultaneously shows the frequency distributions of two categorical variables that do not have too many levels or categories. 

<!--For this lesson, we are only going to explore **two-way cross-tabulations**, that is, contingency tables where we plot the frequency distribution of two variables at the same time. As we learned during the first week we can get results from R in a variety of ways. You can produce basic tables with some of the core functions in R. However, in order to produce the sort of cross-tabs  we will use, I suggest you install and load the package `gmodels`. This package allows you to produce cross tabulations in a format similar to the one used by commercial statistical packages SPSS and SAS. Since some of you may have some previous experience with SPSS we will use the SPSS format. Cross-tabs with this package are more useful for our purposes than the default you may get with the core R `table()` function.-->

#### Activity 7: Cross-tabulations

To explore some relationships related to the fear of crime, we produce a cross-tabulation of victimisation (`bcsvictim`) and whether rubbish is a problem in the area where the respondent lives (`rubbcomm`). According to [*Broken Windows Theory*](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/), proposed by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling, we should see a relationship between these two variables. 

First, we get to know our variables:
<br>

```{r}

# Seeing what class these variables are
class(BCS0708$bcsvictim)
class(BCS0708$rubbcomm)

# 0-Not victim of crime; 1-Victim of crime
attributes(BCS0708$bcsvictim) 

# 5-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (very common) to 4 (not common) 
attributes(BCS0708$rubbcomm)

table(BCS0708$bcsvictim)

# Change 

# If you want the frequency distribution with labels, use ‘as_factor ()’
table(as_factor(BCS0708$bcsvictim))
table(as_factor(BCS0708$rubbcomm))

# Checking for any missing values using ‘sum ()’ to count number of NA data
sum(is.na(BCS0708$bcsvictim))

# 5 are indicated as missing
sum(is.na(BCS0708$rubbcomm))

```
<br>


For the DV, `rubbcomm`, we are missing 611 observations. For our class, keep in mind that all the statistical tests you will learn rely on **full cases analysis** whereby the tests exclude observations that have missing values. There are appropriate ways in dealing with missing data but this is beyond the scope of this class. 

<!--There are a couple of ways of producing cross-tabulations in `R`:
<br>

```{r}

# Basic R
table(as_factor(BCS0708$bcsvictim), 
      as_factor(BCS0708$rubbcomm))

The `dplyr` coding seems more complicated than that of `basic R` but its output is clearer to read than the one produced by `R`, and it is more detailed. The proportion of victimised individuals are within each of the levels of the categorical, ordered measure of rubbish in the area. Victimisation appears higher (31%) in the areas where rubbish in the streets is a very common problem. -->

Although, previously, we have learned how to obtain contingency tables with the `table()` function from `base R` and with the `dplyr` package, the best package is `gmodels`. It allows you to produce cross-tabulations in a format similar to the one used by commercial statistical packages SPSS and SAS. We use the function `CrossTable ()` , then the `with()` function to identify the data frame at the outset instead of having to include it with each variable. 
<br>

```{r}

# Is the package `gmodels` loaded?

# Define the rows in your table (rubbcomm) and then the variable that will define the columns (bcsvictim)
with(BCS0708, CrossTable(as_factor(rubbcomm), 
                         as_factor(bcsvictim), prop.chisq = FALSE, format = c("SPSS")))

```
<br>

 

Cells for the central two columns are the total number of cases in each category, comprising the *row percentages*, the *column percentages*, and the *total percentages*. 
The cross-tabulation shows that 63 people in the category ‘rubbish is very common’ were victims of a crime; this represents 30.88% of all the people in the ‘rubbish is very common’ category (your row percent), 2.79% of all the people in the 'victim of a crime' category (your column percent), and 0.57% of all the people in the sample. 

There is quite a lot of proportions that the contingency table will churn out, but you are only interested in the proportions or percentages that allow you to make meaningful comparisons. Again, this is where talk about independent and dependent variables come in. Although talking about variables like this is not common in these analyses as they would be, say, in regression, an analysis we learn later, it is good to get into the mindset of arranging our variables in this way. 

If you believe in broken windows theory, you will think of victimisation as the outcome we want to explain ($Y$) and rubbish in the area as a possible explanation for the variation in victimisation ($X$). If so, you will need to request percentages that allow you to make comparisons across `rubbcomm` for the outcome, `bcsvictim`. 

This is a very **important** point: often, cross tabulations are interpreted the wrong way because percentages were specified incorrectly. Two rules to help ensure you interpret crosstabs correctly:

<br>
 
1.	If your dependent variable is defining the rows, then you ask for the *column percentages*

2.	If your dependent variable is defining the columns, then you ask for the *row percentages*

<br>
 

Also, *you make the comparisons across the right percentages in the direction where they do not add up to a hundred percent*. For example, 30.88% of people who live in areas where rubbish is very common have been victimised, whereas only 15.54% of people who live in areas where rubbish is not at all common have been victimised in the previous year. To make it easier, we can ask `R` to only give us the percentages in that we are interested:
<br>

```{r}

# prop.c is column and prop.t is total
with(BCS0708, CrossTable(as_factor(rubbcomm), 
                         as_factor(bcsvictim), 
                         prop.chisq = FALSE, prop.c = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE, format =
                           c("SPSS")))

```
<br>

Now with this output, we only see the row percentages. **Marginal frequencies** appear as the right column and bottom row. *Row marginals* show the total number of cases in each row. For example, 204 people perceive rubbish as very common in the area where they are living and 1,244 perceive rubbish as fairly common in their area. *Column marginals* show the total number of cases in each column: 8,804 non-victims and 2,261 victims.

In the central cells, these are the total number for each combination of categories. For example, for row percentages, 63 people who perceive rubbish as very common in their area and who are a victim of a crime represent 30.88% of all people who have reported that rubbish is common (63 out of 204). For column percentages (shown previously), 63 people who live in areas where rubbish is very common and are victims represent 2.79% of all people who were victims of crime (63 out of 2,261). 

<br>

#### Acivity 8: Comparing categorical variables with chi-square test

We now have an understanding of crosstabs so that we can interpret the chi-square statistic. Our null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:

<br>

$H_0$: Victimisation and how common rubbish is in the area are not related to each other. (They are considered independent of each other.)
<br>

$H_A$: Victimisation and how common rubbish is in the area are significantly related to each other. (They are considered dependent on each other.)

<br>
 

We use the chi-square test because it compares these expected frequencies with the ones we actually observe in each of the cells; then averages the differences across the cells; and produces a standardised value, *χ*$^2$ (the chi-square statistic).

We then would observe the chi-square distribution to see how probable or improbable this value is. But, in practice, the p-value helps us ascertain this more quickly. 

**Expected frequencies** are the number of cases you would expect to see in each cell within a contingency table if there was no relationship between the two variables -- if the null hypothesis were true. **Observed frequencies** are the cases that we actually see in our sample. We use the `CrossTable ()` function again: 
<br>

```{r}

with(BCS0708, CrossTable(as_factor(rubbcomm), 
                         as_factor(bcsvictim), 
                         expected = TRUE, prop.c = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE, format =
                           c("SPSS") ))

```
<br>
 

The output shows that, for example, 63 people lived in areas where rubbish was very common and experienced victimisation in the past year. Under the null hypothesis of no relationship, however, we should expect this value to be 41.69 (the expected value). Thus, more people are in this cell than we would expect under the null hypothesis. 

The chi-square value is 184.04, with 3 degrees of freedom (df). The df is obtained by the number of rows minus one, then multiplied by the number of columns minus one: (4 − 1)*(2 − 1). 

The p-value associated with this particular value is nearly zero (p= 1.180e-39). This value is considerably lower than the standard alpha level of 0.05. We conclude that there is a significant relationship between victimisation and the presence of rubbish. We reject the null hypothesis.

If you do not want to use `CrossTable()`, you can use `chisq.test()`  to give you only the chi-square value:
<br>
 

```{r}

chisq.test(BCS0708$rubbcomm, BCS0708$bcsvictim)

```
<br>

<br>

---

#### Fisher's exact test

For the chi-square to work though, it needs to have a sufficient number of cases in each cell. Notice that `R` was telling us that the minimum expected frequency is 41.68. One rule of thumb is that all expected cell counts should be above 5. If we do have a small number in the cells, one alternative is to use **Fisher’s exact test**:
<br>

```{r, eval= FALSE}

fisher.test(BCS0708$rubbcomm, BCS0708$bcsvictim)

```

```{r}
# If you get an error message about increasing the size of your workspace, do so with this code:
fisher.test(BCS0708$rubbcomm, BCS0708$bcsvictim, workspace = 2e+07, hybrid = TRUE)

```
<br>

 

We did not need this test for our example, but we use it to illustrate how to use Fisher’s Exact Test when counts in cells are low (less than five). The p-value from Fisher’s exact test is still smaller than $\alpha = 0.05$, so we reach the same conclusion that the relationship observed can be generalised to the population. 

In addition, the chi-square statistic only tells us whether there is a relationship between two variables; it says nothing about the strength of relationship or exactly what differences between observed and expected frequencies are driving the results. We will need to conduct further analyses to address these.


#### Effect size measures related to chi-square 

Now that we can generalise to the population, we want to know the magnitude of the difference or the strength of the relationship. We will look at a few ways to talk about this: one, for differences between the observed and expected observations; second, for  


###### Activity 9: Residuals

We had observed that there were differences between the observed and expected frequencies. This is called a **residual**. Some differences seem larger than others. For example, there were about 21 more people that lived in areas where rubbish was very common and they experienced victimisation than what was expected under the null hypothesis. When you see large differences, it is unsurprising to also expect that the cell in question may be playing a particularly strong role in driving the relationship between rubbish and victimisation. 

We are not sure, however, of what is considered a large residual. A statistic that helps address this is the **adjusted standardised residuals**, which behaves like a z-score. Residuals indicate the difference between the expected and observed counts on a standardised scale. When the null hypothesis is true, there is only about a 5% chance that any particular standardised residual exceeds 2 in absolute value. 

Whenever you see differences that are greater than 2, the difference between expected and observed frequencies in that particular cell is significant and is driving the results of your chi-square test. Values above +3 or below −3 are considered convincing evidence of a true effect in that cell:
<br>

```{r}

# Include argument ‘asresid= TRUE’ to include adjusted standardised residuals
with(BCS0708, CrossTable(as_factor(rubbcomm), as_factor(bcsvictim), expected = TRUE,
                         prop.chisq = FALSE, prop.c = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE, asresid =
                           TRUE, format = c("SPSS") ))

```
<br>


The column representing the outcome of interest (victimisation present), shows the adjusted standardised residual is −12.61 for the ‘not at all common’ category. That is the largest residual for the DV. The expected count under the null hypothesis in this cell is much higher than the observed count.

<br>
<br>

---

##### Activity 10: Gamma

The residuals seem to be suggesting that the difference is not trivial. Apart from looking at the residuals, one of the tests discussed in the required reading as a test for the strength of a relationship is Goodman-Kruskal's Gamma. **Gamma** is a measure of the strength of the relationship between either two ordinal variables or, as in this case, when one variable is ordinal and the other is a binary variable. 

<!--> Gamma is appropriate for testing the relationship between two categorical ordered variables (ordinal-level variables) or between a categorical ordered variable and a categorical unordered variables with only two levels (a dichotomous variable, such as "victimisation": that only has two levels, you have or you haven't experienced a victimisation). -->

We will use the package `vcdExtra` to compute gamma: 
<br>

```{r}

# We create a new object in tabular form because the function we use to compute Gamma is table()
mytable.2 <- table(BCS0708$bcsvictim, BCS0708$rubbcomm) 

# Print the content of this object to see that it is simply the crosstab
print(mytable.2)

```
<br>

We then use the `GKgamma()` function from the `vcdExtra` package to compute the Gamma measure of association:
<br>
 
```{r} 

# Between the parenthesis you need to identify the object that contains the data
GKgamma(mytable.2) 

```
<br> 

Gamma can take on values ranging from −1 to +1, where: 0 indicates no relationship at all; a negative value indicates a negative relationship; and a positive value a positive relationship. The closer the value is to either −1 or +1, the stronger the relationship is between variables. 

Our output shows that gamma is positive: this suggests that the higher order of the categories in the ordinal measure (rubbish) is associated with higher values in the second variable (victimisation). Higher in this context mean the order in which they appear in your table. So the highest in your ordinal measure (how common rubbish is) refers to the last row (very common). And highest in the dichotomous measure refers to the last column (victim of a crime). Keep this in mind when interpreting gamma. 

The larger the absolute value of gamma, the stronger the association. There are not clear rules of thumb in how to interpret Gamma. This value is larger than 0, although closer to 0 than to 1. De Vaus (2002) provides the following rules of thumb:  up to .10 (trivial association), .10 to .29 (low to moderate), .30 to .49 (moderate to substantial), .50 to .69 (substantial to very strong), .70 to .89 (very strong), .9 and above (near perfect). On those bases, I would say this particular Gamma estimated at .226 indicates an association of modest size. Notice that the confidence interval is provided. So the estimated gamma with an alpha level of 0.05 is estimated to be anywhere between 0.302 and 0.229. If this confidence interval overlapped with 0 we could not reject the null hypothesis.

Gamma, however, assumes a "linear" relationship, more in one of the variables, more in the other (for positive relationships), less in one, more in the other (for negative relationships). Here we can see that the percentage of people that experience victimisation is almost the same for those who live in areas where rubbish is fairly common but also for those who live in areas where it is very common. That is, once we reach a certain level of rubbish the risk of victimisation does not go much higher. In situations like this gamma is likely underestimating the strength of the relationship.

##### Activity 11: Odds and odd ratios

When you have two dichotomous nominal level variables, that is, two nominal level variables that can take only two possible levels, one of the more commonly used measures to indicate the strength of an association are odd ratios. Odd ratios and relative risk are very commonly used in public health and in criminological research. If you have knowledge of betting, you may already know a thing or two about odds.

They are the statistical equivalent of a tongue twister, so don't worry too much if you need to keep looking at this handout every time you want to interpret them. We are going to look at the relationship between victimisation and living in a rural/urban setting: 

```{r}
with(BCS0708, CrossTable(rural2, bcsvictim, prop.c = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE, expected = TRUE, format = c("SPSS")))
```

So we can see that 22% of urban dwellers by comparison to 14% of those living in rural areas have experienced a victimisation in the previous past year. It looks as if living in an urban environment constitutes a risk factor or is associated with victimisation. The Chi Square we obtain has a low p value suggesting that this association is statistically significant. That is, we can possibly infer that there is an association in the population from which the sample was drawn. But how large is this relationship? 

This is where odd ratios are handy. Before we get to them I will discuss a simple tip in layout.  Risk ratios and odd ratios are very commonly used in the public health tradition. In this tradition researchers place the disease/condition defining the columns and the treatment or risk factor defining the rows and they do so in such a way that the first cell correspond to the intersection of the outcome and the risk factor. And the software that computes odd ratios tends to assume this is how your table is set up. So, whenever you are after the relative risks or odd ratios (that is, whenever you work with a 2X2 table) you should laid the table like this as well. It will help interpretation:

+-------------------+---------------------+-----------------+
|                   | Outcome: Yes        | Outcome: No     |
+-------------------+---------------------+-----------------+
| Risk factor: Yes  |                     |                 |
+-------------------+---------------------+-----------------+
| Risk factor: No   |                     |                 |
+-------------------+---------------------+-----------------+

Our table was set up in such a way that the rows are defined by our "risk factor" and the columns by our outcome. But the first cell represents the intersection of the presence of the risk factor and the absence of the outcome. The easiest way to sort this out is to change the order of the levels in our factor variable identifying the outcome ("bcsvictim"). If we ask R to print the levels of the bcsvictim variable we will see that they are as follow:

```{r}
print(levels(BCS0708$bcsvictim))
print(levels(BCS0708$rural2))
```

We want to reverse this. So that "victim of crime" becomes the first level (appears first in the print out) and "urban" becomes the first level as well. There are various ways of doing that with add-on packages, this is an easy way using base R:

```{r}
BCS0708$bcsvictimR <- as_factor(BCS0708$bcsvictim)
print(levels(BCS0708$bcsvictimR))
BCS0708$urban <- as_factor(BCS0708$rural2)
print(levels(BCS0708$urban))


```

We can now rerun the previous cross tabulation (with the newly created reordered factors) and the table will look as below:

```{r}
with(BCS0708, CrossTable(urban, bcsvictimR, prop.c = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE, expected = TRUE, format = c("SPSS")))
```

In order to understand odd ratios and relative risk is important to understand risks and odds first. The **risk** is simply the probability of the "outcome" we are concerned about (i.e., victimisation). So the risk of victimisation for urban dwellers is simply the number of victimised urban dwellers (1945) divided by the total number of urban dwellers (8702). This is .2235. Similarly we can look at the risk of victimisation for people living in rural areas: the number of victimised countryside residents (413) divided by the total number of residents in rural areas (2974).  This is .1388. The **relative risk** is simply the ratio of these two risks. In this case this yields 1.60. This suggests that urban dwellers are 1.60 times more likely to be victimised than people who live in rural areas.

The **odds** on the other hand contrast the number of individuals with the outcome with those without the outcome for each of the rows. Notice the difference with the risk. So the odds of victimisation for urban dwellers equal the number of victimised urban dwellers (1945) by the number of non-victimised urban dwellers (6757). This is .2878. There are .2878 victimised urban dwellers for every non-victimised urban dweller. And the odds of victimisation for residents of rural areas equal the number of victimised rural residents (413) by the number of non-victimised rural residents (2561). This is .1612. There are .1612 victimised rural residents for every non-victimised rural resident.

The **odds ratio** is the ratio of these two odds. So the odds ratio of victimisation for urban dwellers to rural residents is the odds of victimisation for urban dwellers (.2878) divided by the odds of victimisation for rural residents (.1612). This yields 1.78. This means that the odds of victimisation are almost 1.78 times higher for urban dwellers than for residents in rural areas. 

You can use R to obtain the odd ratios directly. We can use the `vcd` package we mentioned earlier. As before we first create an object with the table and then ask for the ordinary odds ratio using the following code:

```{r}
library(vcd)
mytable.3<-table(BCS0708$urban, BCS0708$bcsvictimR)
oddsratio(mytable.3, stratum = NULL, log = FALSE) 
```

The  `oddsratio` function here is asking for the oddsratio for the table data in the object called *mytable.3*. The `log=FALSE` requests an ordinary odds ratio and the `stratum` option clarifies your data are not stratified.

What would happen if rather than using the recoded variable ("bcsvictimR") we use the original one?

```{r}
mytable.4<-table(BCS0708$urban, BCS0708$bcsvictim)
print(mytable.4)
oddsratio(mytable.4, stratum = NULL, log = FALSE)
```

What's going on? Why do we have a different value here? If you look at the cross tab you should be able to understand. R is now computing the odd ratio for "not being a victim of a crime" (since this is what defines the first column). When an odds ratio is below 1 is indicating that the odds in the first row ("urban") are lower than in the second row ("rural"). Living in urban areas (as contrasted with living in rural areas) reduces the likelihood of non-victimisation. 

How to interpret odd ratios? Something that is important to keep in mind is that odd ratios (and relative risk) are non-negative values, that is: they cannot take negative values (i.e., -1, -3, etc.). They can go from 1 to infinite but only from 1 to zero. If the value is greater than 1 that means that, as in this case, living in an urban area increases the chances of the event, being a victim in this example. If the value were to be between 0 and 1 that would mean that the factor in question reduces the chances of the event you are trying to predict. Finally, a value of 1 means that there is no relationship between the two variables: it would mean that the odds or the risks are the same for the two groups.

Whenever the odd ratio is between 0 and 1 that means that the odds of whatever it is defining the first column (in the more recent table we printed not being a victim) is lower for the first row (in this case living in an urban area) than in the second row (in this case living in a rural area). To read an odd ratio that is between 0 and 1 you first need to take its inverse, so in this case 1/0.5602 will give you 1.78. What this is telling you is that the odds of not being a victim of victim are 1.78 times less for men than for women, which is the same as to say that the odds of being a victim of assault are 1.78 more for men than for women. That is, odd ratios are reciprocal.

You may be confused by now. Have a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFHL54yOniI), it may help to see an oral presentation of these ideas with a different example.  Repeated practice will make it easier to understand. The fact that the interpretation of these quantities is contingent in the way we have laid out our table makes it particularly advisable to hand calculate them as explained above in relation to the outcome you are interested until you are comfortable with them. This may help you to see more clearly what you are getting and how to interpret it. When looking at the R results for odd ratios just always keep in mind that you are aware of what are the reference categories (what defines the first column and the first row) when reading and interpreting odd ratios. The R function we introduced will always give you the odds ratio for the event defined in the first column and will contrast the odds for the group defined by the first row with the odds defined by the second row. If the odds ratio is between 0 and 1 that would mean the odds are lower for the first row, if the odds is greater than 1 that would mean the odds are higher for the second row.

It is also very important you do not confuse the relative risk (a ratio of probabilities) with the odds ratio (a ratio of odds). Be very careful with the language you use when interpreting these quantities.

Odd ratios are ratios of odds, not probability ratios. You cannot say that urban dwellers are 1.78 more likely to be victimised. All you can say with an odd ratio is that the odds of being victimised are 1.78 times higher for urban dwellers than for residents in rural areas. Odds and probabilities are different things.

It is also very important that you interpret these quantities carefully. You will often see media reports announcing things such as that chocolate consumption will double your risk of some terrible disease. What that means is that the percentage of cases of individuals that take chocolate and present the condition is twice as large as those that do not take chocolate and present the condition. But you also need to know what those percentages are to put it in the right context. If those probabilities are very low to start with, well, does it really matter?

## SUMMARY


 

We learned a few inferential statistical analyses to examine relationships with categorical variables, known as **factors** in `R`. These variables, in today’s analyses, were arranged as **independent variables** or **dependent variables**. When analysing a relationship between a categorical and a numeric variable, the t-test was used. We learned to conduct **independent sample** and **dependent sample** t-tests. 

Before we performed the former t-test, we conducted the **test for equality of variance**. We also learned about effect size with **Cohen's d**. In the latter section, we learned to conduct a chi-square test, a test of statistical significance between two categorical variables. This involved **contingency tables**, whereby we examined specifically **cross tabulations**. 

The chi-square statistic contrasts **expected** and **observed** frequencies in the cross-tab. When counts in any one cell is lower than five, **Fisher’s Exact Test** is used instead. We also check the **adjusted standardised residuals** to identify which contrast of frequencies are driving the observed results. We also learned about effect size here too with **Gamma** and **Odds Ratios**.
